Program Functions:

Read and write image files and perform image rotation before saving.
Draw a histogram of the grayscale image.
Add the functionality to introduce white noise.
Generate Gaussian white noise with user-input variance or standard deviation.
Generate salt and pepper noise, allowing the user to input the percentage of noise.
Add a new convolution operation that can perform image smoothing and edge detection effects.

Program Flow or Algorithm:
Step 1 (Lines 196-215): Implement the convolution function.
Step 2: Input a grayscale image and convert it into an array.
Step 3: Traverse the image array while applying a 5x5 mask.
Step 4: Multiply the values at each position and add the result to the img array.
Step 5: Display the convolution result in label2.

It appears that you have extended your program to include convolution operations for image processing. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this part of the implementation or any other aspect of your program, please feel free to ask.
