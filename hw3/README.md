Program Functions:

Read and write image files and perform image rotation before saving.
Draw a histogram of the grayscale image.
Add the functionality to introduce white noise.
Generate Gaussian white noise with user-input variance or standard deviation.
Generate salt and pepper noise, allowing the user to input the percentage of noise.

Program Flow or Algorithm:
Step 1 to 10: Follow the procedures outlined in the previous description.
Step 11: Define a Gaussian noise function, following the algorithm from section 2.3.
Step 12: Iterate through pixels.
Step 13: Update two pixels at a time by adding the results of z1 and z2 calculations to the pixels.
Step 14: Display all images (original, pure noise, Gaussian noise).
Step 15: Define a salt and pepper noise function.
Step 16: Iterate through pixels.
Step 17: Update one pixel at a time based on the input probability to set it to 0, 255, or the original pixel value.
Step 18: Display all images (original, pure noise, salt and pepper).

Your program seems comprehensive and covers various aspects of image processing, including noise generation and manipulation. If you have any specific questions or need assistance with any part of the implementation, please feel free to ask.
